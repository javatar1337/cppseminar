# cppseminar

C++ Graph library project for PB173 seminar at FI MUNI.
Library offers support for directed, undirected, unweighted, weighted graphs and their combinations.

Graph classes are parametrized by type of vertex and type of edge.

Supported algorithms:
BFS (parametrized by functions)
DFS (parametrized by functions)
Dijkstra's algorithm 
Bellman–Ford algorithm
Prim's algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm
Edmonds–Karp algorithm
